                With more than 350 campers and CITs, our staff of volunteers must review every form before camp begins. That is why we require all forms to be sent with payment during registration. Campers will not be accepted until all required forms and payment are received. If you have difficulty meeting the deadline due to special reasons, please contact <a href="mailto:registration@necysc.org">registration@necysc.org</a>.

                Campers will NOT be allowed to leave camp during the week. This includes routine doctor's visits, sports practices, rehearsals, etc. All routine/non-emergency appointments should be scheduled outside of camp week. Should an unforeseen situation arise, please advise the camp director(s) who will make a case-by-case judgment.

                We encourage campers to stay for the full week and participate with their groups in the Closing Ceremonies. However, under extenuating circumstances, prior to the start of camp, parents can complete the Request for Early Check-Out form from Registration. Parents will be expected to complete the check-out procedure within the designated early check-out hour on Friday (Day Camp).
